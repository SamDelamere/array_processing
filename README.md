array_processing
================

[![](https://readthedocs.org/projects/uaf-array-processing/badge/?version=master)](https://uaf-array-processing.readthedocs.io/)

Various array processing tools for infrasound and seismic data. By default uses
least-squares to determine the trace velocity and back-azimuth of a plane wave
crossing an array in sliding time windows. More advanced processing (such as
least-trimmed squares) is easily integrated. Also provides tools to characterize
the array response, uncertainty, source-location of a spherical wave crossing
the array, etc. See
[documentation](https://uaf-array-processing.readthedocs.io/) and
[`example.py`](https://github.com/uafgeotools/array_processing/blob/master/example.py)
for more info.

Installation
------------

We recommend you install this package into a new
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) environment.
(Please install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) before proceeding.)
The environment must contain all of the packages listed in the
[Dependencies](#dependencies) section. For ease of installation, we've provided
an
[`environment.yml`](https://github.com/uafgeotools/array_processing/blob/master/environment.yml)
file which specifies all of these dependencies as well as instructions for
installing _array_processing_ itself. To install _array_processing_ in this
manner, execute the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/uafgeotools/array_processing.git
cd array_processing
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This creates a new conda environment named `uafinfra` and installs
_array_processing_ and all of its dependencies there.

The final command above installs _array_processing_ in "editable" mode, which
means that you can update it with a simple `git pull` in your local repository.
We recommend you do this often, since this code is still under rapid
development.

Dependencies
------------

_uafgeotools_ packages:

* [_waveform_collection_](https://github.com/uafgeotools/waveform_collection)
* [_lts_array_](https://github.com/uafgeotools/lts_array)

Python packages:

* [ObsPy](http://docs.obspy.org/)

Usage
-----

Import the package like any other Python package, ensuring the correct
environment is active. For example,
```
$ conda activate uafinfra
$ python
>>> import array_processing
```
Documentation is available online
[here](https://uaf-array-processing.readthedocs.io/). For a usage example, see
[`example.py`](https://github.com/uafgeotools/array_processing/blob/master/example.py).
